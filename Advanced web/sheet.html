      <p>My job as an Aircraft Structural Repairer had many responsibilities. From treating the metal prior to repairs, to cutting out sections of the 
          helicopter, fabricating parts, installing, and reenforcing the repairs.  
      <br>
      We worked with several types of metals; from aluminum, steel, titanium, and even O material aluminum which is a soft and pliable
      metal that we would shape complex parts and then it has to be baked in a kiln.  
        <br>
      <p>
          This is a repair that I personally completed on an oil cooler support beam.
