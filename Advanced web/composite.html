      <p>I was required to do composite repairs on the Aircrafts as well. This includes but not limited to fiberglass, carbon fiber, and kevlar.
      <br>
     Many of these repairs were on the helicopter blades, as well as the fairings (which is like a shell that gets placed on top of the aircraft).
     <br>
     This is a composite repair that I did on a CH-47(Chinook) helicopter blade.
